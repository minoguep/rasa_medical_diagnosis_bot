# Rasa medical diagnosis bot

This repository contains the source code used in [my Rasa medical bot tutorial](https://paulminogue.com/).
I have also created a [separate repository](https://github.com/minoguep/diagnosis_bot_data_prep) which outlines some
of the preliminary data prep involved in a jupyter notebook.

If you want to learn more about Rasa, or read the detailed documentation, you can do as at
